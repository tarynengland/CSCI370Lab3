Our game is Viking Chef
The intent is for the player look for ingrediants as they skillfully leap from on platform to another
Our viking character is in need of ingrediants for a feast. He has to look for enough ingrediants to feed his village
The player can move with WASD keys or by using arrow keys
Our asthetics change as the player progresses. It starts with floating plains with trees and grass, then the player will encounter three different looking caves to explore. Finally, the player will exit the caves and return to grassy plains where they will find the final area of a small castle.
Dealing with the positioning of platforms were tedius. The platforms have to be placed so that it requires skill to reach but also so that it isn't nearly impossible to jump to. Dealing with multiple scenes was also tiring and required research to be able to put into practice. Some of the joys were watching everything come together. Seeing the game go from a bland platformer to a game with graphics, animations and dialogue was very enjoyable.
